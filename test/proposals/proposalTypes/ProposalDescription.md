#  MIP-B01 Moonwell BASE IR Param Recommendation for WETH

Gauntlet recommends adjusting the interest rate (IR) parameters for WETH in order to boost borrowing demand for use in LST leverage yield strategies and augment capital efficiency within the protocol. Gauntlet recommends the following IR adjustments:

| IR Parameters   | Current | Recommended |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Base            | 0.02    | 0.01           |
| Kink            | 0.6     | 0.75         |
| Multiplier      | 0.15    | 0.04        |
| Jump Multiplier | 3       | 1           |
