# Overview

This document explains how to add new markets to Moonwell from end to end,
leveraging existing tooling in a way that allows integration and governance
testing both pre and post-deploy.

## 1. Setup

### Directory Structure

All MIPS should be placed in the `proposals/mips/mip-bxx` folder, where bxx is
the next available MIP number. If the next available MIP number is 4, then the
folder should be named `mip-b04`. You should copy all of the existing files from
the `proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing` folder into the new `mip-bxx`
folder as a starting point. The only 3 files that are required are `MIP-Bxx.md`,
`MTokens.json`, and `RewardStreams.json`. The `MIP-Bxx.md` file is the proposal
description, the `MTokens.json` file is the configuration for the MTokens being
added, and the `RewardStreams.json` file is the configuration for the reward
streams being added.

Please also copy the
[`mip-market-listing.sol`](./src/proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing/mip-market-listing.sol)
file into the new `mip-bxx` folder and rename it to `mip-bxx.sol`. This file is
the Solidity script that will deploy the new markets and generate the calldata
for the governance proposal. Even though you won't be executing it from this
path, it's good to keep it as a reference to the version of code used to deploy
the market.

### MTokens

Go to `mainnetMTokensExample.json` to see what an example mToken JSON
configuration looks like. Copy the file
[`MTokens.json`](./src/proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing/MTokens.json)
in the `proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing` folder to a new `mip-bxx`
folder, replacing all of the values with the correct values for those markets.
Initial mint amount, collateral factor, should be set to the correct values and
replaced with the actual values the market should have once deployed.

```
        "initialMintAmount": 1e12,
        "collateralFactor": 0.75e18,
        "reserveFactor": 0.25e18,
        "seizeShare": 0.03e18,
        "supplyCap": 10500e18,
        "borrowCap": 6300e18,
        "priceFeedName": "ETH_ORACLE",
        "tokenAddressName": "WETH",
        "name": "Moonwell WETH",
        "symbol": "mWETH",
        "addressesString": "MOONWELL_WETH",
        "jrm": {
            "baseRatePerYear": 0.02e18,
            "multiplierPerYear": 0.15e18,
            "jumpMultiplierPerYear": 3e18,
            "kink": 0.6e18
        }
```

- `initialMintAmount` amount of tokens to mint during gov proposal, if token has
  18 decimals, should be `1e12`, if token has 6 decimals, should be `1e6`. If
  token has greater than 18 decimals, decimals should be token decimals - 6
  decimals. Temporal Governor must be funded with the initialMintAmount of said
  tokens before the proposal is executed in order for the proposal to succeed.
- `collateralFactor` the percentage of value of supplied assets that is counted
  towards an account's collateral value, scaled up by `1e18`. Must be less than
  `1e18` to ensure system solvency.
- `reserveFactor` percentage of interest accrued that goes to the Moonwell DAO
  reserves, scaled up by `1e18`.
- `seizeShare` percentage of seized collateral that goes to protocol reserves
  when a liquidation occurs, scaled up by `1e18`.
- `supplyCap` cap of amount of assets that can be supplied for a given market.
- `borrowCap` cap of amount of assets that can be borrowed for a given market.
- `priceFeedName` name of the chainlink aggregator address in `Addresses.json`.
  **Note user must add the address to Addresses.json on the proper network
  pre-deployment in order for the price feed to be set correctly**
- `tokenAddressName` name of the underlying token address name for the new
  market, set in `Addresses.json`. **Note user must add the underlying token
  address to Addresses.json on the proper network pre-deployment in order for
  the MToken's underlying address to be set correctly**
- `name` name of the Moonwell MToken. Prefixed with `Moonwell`.
- `symbol` symbol of the Moonwell MToken. Prefixed with `m`.
- `addressesString` name of the address string set in `Addresses.json`.
- `jrm` parameters for the configuration of a JumpRateModel for each MToken.
- `baseRatePerYear` cost to borrow per year as a percentage, scaled by `1e18`.
- `multiplierPerYear` multiplier on the base rate, which creates the curve of
  the rate before kink is hit, as a percentage, scaled by `1e18`.
- `jumpMultiplierPerYear` rate multiplier as a percentage, scaled by `1e18`
  after kink is hit.
- `kink` the point on the utilization curve after which the interest rate spikes
  using `jumpMultiplierPerYear` as a percentage, scaled by `1e18`

If there are no MTokens being added, the file is still needed, but it should
contain an empty array.

### RewardStreams

Go to `mainnetRewardStreams.json` to see what an example reward JSON
configuration looks like. Copy the file
[`RewardStreams.json`](./src/proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing/RewardStreams.json)
in the `proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing` folder into the new
`mip-bxx` folder, replacing all of the values with the correct values for those
markets.

If there are no reward streams, the file is still needed, but it should contain
an empty array.

## 2. Proposal Description

Once the proposal description has been created, copy and paste it into a file
named `MIP-Bxx.md` in the new `mip-bxx` folder.

## 3. Environment Variables

Once both the `MIP-Bxx.md`, `MTokens.json`, and `RewardStreams.json` files have
the necessary contents, environment variables must be set for the script to read
in their path. Export the following environment variables pointing to the
correct paths:

```
export LISTING_PATH="./src/proposals/mips/mip-bxx/MIP-Bxx.md"
export MTOKENS_PATH="./src/proposals/mips/mip-bxx/MTokens.json"
export EMISSION_PATH="./src/proposals/mips/mip-bxx/RewardStreams.json"
```

Set the `BASE_RPC_URL` environment variable to the RPC URL of base. This can be
done using the public RPC endpoint.

```
BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
```

Or by setting to a private RPC endpoint if the public end point is not working.

To get local tests running a chainfork with the new proposal type, set the
`PROPOSAL_ARTIFACT_PATH` to the path of the proposal artifact. For example, if
the proposal artifact is located at `artifacts/foundry/mip-b05.sol/mipb05.json`,
the environment variable should be set to:

`export PROPOSAL_ARTIFACT_PATH=artifacts/foundry/mip-b05.sol/mipb05.json`

Once this has been set, then integration tests can be created which ensure the
proposal is working as expected.

If deploying and generating calldata for the first time, environment variable
`DO_AFTER_DEPLOY_MTOKEN_BROADCAST` should be set to true. After doing deploy and
setting the addresses in `Addresses.json`, this variable should be set to false.
This variable is used to determine whether or not to broadcast the after deploy
transactions that configure the MToken, which are not needed after the tokens
are deployed.

If any errors show up relating to not being able to read in a file, double check
the environment variables and make sure the paths are correct.

## 4. Deployment

To deploy these new markets, run
[`mip-market-listing.sol`](./src/proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing/mip-market-listing.sol)
using command:

```
forge script src/proposals/mips/examples/mip-market-listing/mip-market-listing.sol:mip0x \
    -vvvv \
    --rpc-url base \
    --broadcast
```

Once the contracts are deployed, copy and paste the JSON the deployment script
outputted into the `Addresses.json` file. Now, save these changes and proceed to
the next step. DO NOT DELETE EXISTING JSON, JUST ADD TO IT.

## 5. Governance Proposal

Now that the contracts are deployed, it's time to generate the calldata. If the
contracts have not been deployed and added to Addresses.json yet, go back to
previous steps and do that first:

then, generate the calldata by running:

```
forge test --match-test testPrintNewMarketCalldataAlreadyDeployedMToken -vvv --fork-url base
```

If you encounter errors, ensure the environment variables are set correctly and
the paths are correct.

Environment variable `DO_AFTER_DEPLOY_MTOKEN_BROADCAST` should be set to false
as this step should only be used to generate calldata. This variable is used to
determine whether or not to broadcast the after deploy transactions that
configure the MToken, which are not needed after the tokens are deployed as that
should have been done in the deployment step.

Recommend referring to the GOVPROPOSALS.md file in the root of the repo for more
information on how to generate calldata and deploy contracts. Then run the forge
script command with the proper environment variables after the contracts have
been deployed and addresses added to Addresses.json. Using this output, double
check the calldata generated by the test is correct by comparing it to the
calldata generated by running the commands in the
[GOVPROPOSALS.md](./docs/GOVPROPOSALS.md) file.

Then, scroll up to get the calldata to propose these changes to the DAO. After
section "artemis governor queue governance calldata", copy and paste the
calldata and send the calldata to the governance contract on moonbase by going
to metamask and submitting a transaction to the ArtemisGovernor contract with
the calldata the raw hex copied.

Once the calldata is sent, wait for the proposal to finish the voting period,
then queue and execute it.

## 6. Testing

To test the changes introduced by creating these market(s) and ensure the system
solvency, modify the
[PostProposalCheck](./test/integration/PostProposalCheck.sol) to add the
newMarketDeploy mip to the array of mips tested. This can be done by
uncommenting the line that adds it to the `mips` address array, and lengthening
the array to support 2 active proposals, or if only doing this as a single
proposal, write to mips array at index 0 and comment out the other line adds the
incorrect MIP.

After PostProposalCheck is modified, the view the
[HundredFinanceExploit](./test/unit/HundredFinanceExploit.t.sol) example file,
and replicate the structure where the PostProposalCheck contract is imported and
inherited, then write the necessary tests for these newly added markets,
ensuring supplying, borrowing, repaying all work.

## 7. Safety Checks

This framework is designed to ensure that the system is safe and that the
parameters look to be correct. In the market-listing solidity file, there are
checks that the parameters are within sane values. There are checks around the
supply and borrow cap, and if these values are set to 0, no checks will run,
however, if these values are non zero, the checks will ensure that the supply
and borrow cap are not set to values that are too high. If the value of a supply
or borrow cap exceed 120m tokens adjusted for decimals, then a warning will fire
when running the script and the script will not continue. If these values are
correct, you can override the warnings by setting:

```
export OVERRIDE_SUPPLY_CAP=true
export OVERRIDE_BORROW_CAP=true
```

If you set these variables to true, make sure to set them back to false after
running the proposal to ensure no errors are missed in the future.

If the borrow cap is not equal to 0, and there is no supply cap, this is invalid
for a governance proposal and the creation of the proposal will revert with an
appropriate message.

If the supply cap is set, but the borrow cap is greater than or equal to the
supply cap, this is invalid for a governance proposal and the creation of the
proposal will revert with an appropriate message.

If the collateral factor of a market is set to greater than 95%, then the
creation of the proposal will revert with an appropriate message as it is
assumed that no collateral will ever have a collateral factor higher than 95%.
