# MIP-B01 Moonwell BASE IR Param Recommendation for WETH

Gauntlet recommends adjusting the interest rate (IR) parameters for WETH in
order to boost borrowing demand for use in LST leverage yield strategies and
augment capital efficiency within the protocol. Gauntlet recommends the
following IR adjustments:

| IR Parameters   | Current | Recommended |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Base            | 0.02    | 0.01        |
| Kink            | 0.6     | 0.75        |
| Multiplier      | 0.15    | 0.04        |
| Jump Multiplier | 3       | 1           |
