As part of our role of managing
[Base liquidity incentives](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/warden-finance-base-liquidity-incentives/608),
we will also allocate supply-side rewards once rETH market is deployed to help
bootstrap initial liquidity. We will provide further details regarding rewards
once market is closer to be deployed.

## Analysis

### LST Market Overview

Rocket pool is a decentralized and trustless ETH staking solution. Specific
information about the protocol is available on
[Rocket Poolâ€™s documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/overview/faq.html#what-does-rocket-pool-do).

Rocket Pool is currently the most adopted and liquid decentralized LST available
on the market, which makes it a good candidate to use as collateral asset on
lending protocols.

### LST-specific Risk

<details>
<summary>
About LST-specific risk
</summary>

<hr>

#### Staking incentives and penalties

Validators are rewarded for contributing to the chain's security, and penalized
for failing to contribute. More implementation details about
incentives/penalties is available over there:
https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/penalties/

The reward, penalty and slashing design of the consensus mechanism encourages
individual validators to behave correctly. However, from these design choices
emerges a system that strongly incentivizes equal distribution of validators
across multiple clients, and should strongly disincentivize single-client
dominance.

#### Slashing

Slashing is a more severe action that results in the forceful removal of a
validator from the network and an associated loss of their staked ether. There
are three ways a validator can be slashed, all of which amount to the dishonest
proposal or attestation of blocks:

- By proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot
- By attesting to a block that "surrounds" another one (effectively changing
  history)
- By "double voting" by attesting to two candidates for the same block

Correlation penalty is incurred when a validator is
[slashed](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/slashing/). The penalty
amount is determined based on the amount of validators that also get slashed at
the same moment. Correlation penalty aims to promote decentralization of
validators.

#### Inactivity leak

If the consensus layer has gone more than four epochs without finalizing, an
emergency protocol called the "inactivity leak" is activated.

Quadratic leak is a penalty that is imposed upon validators for being offline
and missing a slot. The more longer a validator is offline, the steeper the
penalty rate is.

#### Insurance

In order to protect stakers funds, protocols may set up some form of insurance
to compensate stakers in case of slashings or offline penalties.

<hr>
</details>

#### Correlation penalty risk

Since Rocket Pool ETH relies on a diverse network of independent nodes, it is
very unlikely that a significant part of the network gets slashed at the same
moment.

#### Quadratic leaking risk profile

Again here, Rocket Pool ETH is less prone to quadratic leaking penalties since
node operators are well distributed and highly diversified.

#### Insurance fund

When creating a minipool validator in the protocol, a minimum of 10% of the
ETH's value provided by rETH stakers must also be staked in RPL as a security
promise to the protocol.

The insurance promise acts as collateral, where if the node operator is
penalized heavily or slashed and finishes staking with less than the 24 (or 16)
ETH provided by rETH stakers, their collateral is sold for ETH via auction to
help compensate the protocol for the missing ETH.

### Volatility Risk

<details>
<summary>About volatility risk</summary>

<hr>
In order to maintain solvency, the protocol must ensure that debts are always overcollateralized by assets of a higher value. If debts were not overcollateralized, borrowers would be economically incentivized to default on their debt. Defaulting would lead to the creation of bad debts in the system.

In order to mitigate asset volatility risk, the protocol enforces liquidations
to ensure that debts are always overcollateralized.

Time to undercollateralization measures the time required during a worst
drawdown event for a highly leveraged position to accumulate bad debt . The
lower the value, the less time is available for liquidators to clear risky
positions.

Our methodology specifies a minimum time to undercollateralization of 60 minutes
for assets with healthy liquidity levels to ensure sufficient time is available
to profitably liquidate risky positions of large size (i.e 20% of supply cap).
Goal of this buffer is to reduce the risk of bad debt accumulating.

<hr>
</details>

The proposed collateral factor of 0.76 for rETH provides a
undercollateralization time buffer of 9,865 minutes (6d 20hrs 24min), which is
in line with other LST markets on Moonwell Base.

Given very low and unstable liquidity levels for rETH on Base at the moment, the
proposed collateral factor aims to leave sufficient time for liquidators to
profitably liquidate risky positions of large size (i.e $100k rETH collateral
position) in a scenario where DEX liquidity is drastically deteriorated.

### Liquidity Risk

<details>
<summary>About liquidity risk</summary>

<hr>

If an account collateral ratio breaches the minimum collateral ratio enforced by
the protocol, it will become eligible for liquidation. In order for liquidators
to be able to liquidate assets at a reasonable price, there must be sufficient
on-chain liquidity for liquidators to liquidate accounts profitably.

Slippage tolerance measures the maximum budget allowed for slippage cost when
liquidating a risky position during worst downturn events.

<hr>

</details>

rETH circulating supply on Base is very low, with 197 rETH ($433k) currently in
circulation. DEX liquidity is also currently not incentivized and concentrated
in a single pool on Balancer, so it is very hard to predict how stable the
liquidity will be in the short term.

Given these uncertainties, we recommend starting with a supply cap that is
substantially less than circulating supply to avoid outsized positions from
joining the market right now while liquidity is sparse.

| Symbol | Circulating supply (Base) | Slippage tolerance      | 4% depth | Proposed supply cap | Proposed borrow cap |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| rETH   | 197 ($433k)               | 4% of seized collateral | $150k    | 100 ($222k)         | 50 ($111k)          |

### Oracle Risk

Oracle risk is the probability of the oracle price feed not accurately tracking
the actual market price.

Given the lack of historical data for rETH on Base, weâ€™ll assume that skew
between oracle and spot price should have a similar behavior than wstETH on
Optimism given an equivalent oracle setup (Chainlink wstETH/ETH + ETH/USD).

During the last 90d, for a similar oracle price feed on Optimism, 99.7% of
observed oracle price skew data points are within [-0.689%, 0.817%].

As a conservative measure, weâ€™ll assume 1% skew in a worst case scenario for
rETH on Base.

## Interest Rate Model

The suggested interest rate model aims to

- Facilitate borrowing rETH considering additional borrowing cost due to staking
  yield (~3.12%)
- Attract more suppliers when liquidity risk is high. Higher borrow rates above
  the kink incentivize borrowers to repay their loans and can attract new
  lenders in order to maximize liquidity at all times.
