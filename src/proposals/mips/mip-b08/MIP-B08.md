# Proposal: Onboard wstETH as collateral on Base deployment

## Summary

We propose onboarding wstETH as collateral on Moonwell Base deployment
conditional to the token being available on Base and significant liquidity being
onboarded subsequently on DEXes.

## Specifications

We propose using the same collateral factor and interest rate model as cbETH. We
will provide further recommendations in regards to supply and borrow caps once
liquidity is available on Base chain.

managing
[Base liquidity incentives](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/warden-finance-base-liquidity-incentives/608),
we will also allocate supply-side rewards once wstETH market is deployed to help
bootstrap initial liquidity. We will provide further details regarding rewards
once more liquidity is available for wstETH on Base.

## Analysis

### LST Market Overview

Lido is by far the most dominant LST solution available. It is the most liquid
option available on-chain.

### LST-specific Risk

Validators are rewarded for contributing to the chain's security, and penalized
for failing to contribute.
https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/penalties/

#### Correlation penalty risk

Correlation penalty is incurred when a validator is
[slashed](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/slashing/). The penalty
amount is determined based on the amount of validators that also get slashed at
the same moment.

Lido is subject to incurring increased correlation penalty due to the relatively
large number of validators managed by individual operators.

#### Quadratic leaking risk profile

Quadratic leak is a penalty that is imposed upon validators for being offline
and missing a slot. The more often a validator is offline, the steeper the
penalty rate is.

Quadratic leak is also a risk factor for stETH due to the lack of diversity in
operators.

#### Insurance fund

In July 2021, the Lido DAO voted to take on self-insurance by allocating a
proportion of funds - in the form of protocol fees - for insurance purposes.

The insurance fund could be used, as an example, to compensate stakers in the
case of slashings (or other risk scenarios outlined
[here](https://research.lido.fi/t/redirecting-incoming-revenue-stream-from-insurance-fund-to-dao-treasury/2528/21?u=kadmil)).

### Volatility Risk

Volatility can be described as a measure of the amplitude of price changes for
an asset over time. Overcollateralized lending protocols like Moonwell are
subject to volatility risks. As collateral and debt asset prices change, the
collateralization of accounts changes.

In order to assess robustness of the suggested parameters, we’ll assume a worst
case scenario where wstETH asset price drops down as much as the worst 1-hour
price drawdown observed for ETH during the last year.

Max drawdown over the last year for ETH is 9.01%.

![|624x224](https://i.imgur.com/PSWWo3O.png)![|624x357](https://i.imgur.com/2OEUMus.png)

### Liquidity Risk

wstETH is not yet launched on Base. We will provide more information once data
is available.

### Oracle Risk

Oracle risk is the probability of the oracle price feed not accurately tracking
the actual market price.

Given the lack of historical data for the proposed oracle price feed on Base
(Chainlink wstETH/ETH + ETH/USD), we’ll assume that skew between oracle and spot
price should be similar to wstETH on Optimism given an equivalent oracle setup.

During the last 90d, for a similar oracle price feed on Optimism, 99.7% of
observed oracle price skew data points are within [-0.689%, 0.817%].

As a conservative measure, we’ll assume 1% skew in a worst case scenario for
wstETH on Base.

## Robustness Test

In order to validate the robustness of the liquidation incentive, collateral
factor and caps our methodology relies on backtesting the profitability of
simulated liquidations given historical market conditions. More information
about our methodology is available on
[Warden’s documentation](https://docs.warden.finance/docs/).

![|624x383](https://i.imgur.com/HH5cWJV.png)

Assuming the following historical market conditions:

| Liquidation cost         | % of seized collateral              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Max drawdown 60min       | 9.05%                               |
| Slippage                 | TBD depending on liquidity and caps |
| Protocol reserve fee     | 3%                                  |
| Oracle / spot price skew | 1%                                  |
| Gas fees                 | 0%                                  |

The buffers necessary for the liquidation to execute profitably can then be
determined:

- Collateral factor needs to provide sufficient buffer to cover for
  - 9.05% drawdown
  - 10% liquidation incentive.
- Liquidation incentive need to provide sufficient buffer to cover for
  - 3% reserve fee
  - 1% oracle / spot price skew
  - TBD slippage

Given above assumptions and liquidation incentive for Moonwell Base deployment
set to 10%:

- Collateral factor must be less than 0.81
- Liquidation incentive offers tolerance for up to 6% slippage cost in a worst
  case scenario.
- Borrow and supply caps must be set low enough to prevent users from holding
  collateral or debt positions that increase the risk for the protocol of
  accumulating bad debt (>6% slippage when liquidated).

The suggested collateral factor (0.75) and current liquidation incentive (10%)
pass the above robustness test. We will follow up with borrow and supply caps
once we have sufficient data to provide recommendations.

### Interest Rate Model

The suggested interest rate model aims to

- Facilitate borrowing wstETH considering additional borrowing cost due to
  staking yield (~3.8%)
- Attract more suppliers when liquidity risk is high. Higher borrow rates above
  the kink incentivize borrowers to repay their loans and can attract new
  lenders in order to maximize liquidity at all times.
