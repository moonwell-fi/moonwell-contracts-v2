# MIP-O01: Add Break Glass Calldata to the Multichain Governor for Optimism

Following the deployment of the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism, the Multichain
Governor whitelisted calldata will be updated to include a break glass call for
the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism. This will allow the Security Council to
execute a break glass call in the Multichain Governor that will add the Artemis
Timelock as a trusted sender on the Optimism Temporal Governor.
