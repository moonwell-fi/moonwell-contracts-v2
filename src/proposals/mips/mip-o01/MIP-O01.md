# MIP-O01: Add Break Glass Calldata to the Multichain Governor for Optimism

Following the deployment of the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism, the Multichain Governor whitelisted calldata will be
updated to include a break glass call for the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism. This will allow the Security Council to
execute a break glass call in the Multichain Governor that will add the Artemis Timelock as a trusted sender on the
Optimism Temporal Governor.
