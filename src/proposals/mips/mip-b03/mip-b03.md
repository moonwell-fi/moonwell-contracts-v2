# MIP-B03 Onboard DAI as collateral

## Summary

We propose onboarding DAI as a collateral asset on Moonwell’s Base deployment.
Due to the market demand and rapid increase in DAI liquidity on Base we think it
appropriate to list the asset as collateral.

## Recommendation

We propose launching DAI as collateral with the following parameters:
|Asset|CF|Supply cap|Borrow cap|IRM|Oracle|Protocol seize share| | --- | --- |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|[DAI](https://basescan.org/token/0x50c5725949a6f0c72e6c4a641f24049a917db0cb)|0.8|6M|5M|Stable|[Chainlink DAI / USD](https://basescan.org/address/0x591e79239a7d679378eC8c847e5038150364C78F)|30%|

We propose to set DAI’s interest rate curve parameters to the stable IRM
configuration.

| Stable IRM Parameter | Value |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Base rate            | 0     |
| Multiplier           | 0.05  |
| Kink                 | 0.8   |
| Jump multiplier      | 2.5   |
| Reserve factor       | 0.15  |

| Utilization            | Borrow rate |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Base utilization (0%)  | 0%          |
| Kink utilization (80%) | 4%          |
| Max utilization (100%) | 56%         |

## Analysis

KPIs for Dai on Base, with USDbC as comparison (as of August 15 2023)

| Asset | Circulating supply (Base) | Circulating supply (all chains) | Bridge        | -5% liquidity depth (to ETH) |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ------------- | ------ |
| DAI   | 15M                       | 4B                              | Base (Native) | $384k                        |     | USDbC | 52M | 26B | Base (Native) | $1.33M |

Given the significant difference in on-chain liquidity of DAI vs USDbC, we
recommend scaling the supply and borrow caps for DAI to around ⅛ of those of
USDbC.

| Market | Supply cap | Borrow cap |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| DAI    | 6M         | 5M         |
| USDbC  | 40M        | 32M        |

## Deployment

We strongly recommend collateral factors to be set at 0 during deployment to
mitigate the risk of someone exploiting a known Compound v2 issue (see
[Hundred Finance exploit](https://www.comp.xyz/t/hundred-finance-exploit-and-compound-v2/4266)).
Steps for safe deployment as proposed by Hexagate are the following:

- Initialize markets using 0 as collateral factor (no borrowing possible).
- Burn a small amount of collateral token supply for each market.
- Set collateral factors for each market as specified
