# MIP-M21: Upgrade Wormhole Bridge Adapter on Moonbeam

## Overview

In preparation for the upcoming upgrade of the WELL token to the
[xERC20 standard](https://www.xerc20.com/), which will enable the token to be
natively used on the Base network for voting and staking, the Wormhole Bridge
Adapter on Moonbeam needs to be upgraded. While the upgraded WELL token is not
yet in use, it is governed by the
[Moonwell governor](https://moonscan.io/address/0xfc4DFB17101A12C5CEc5eeDd8E92B5b16557666d),
so this upgrade must be performed through governance.

This upgraded Wormhole Bridge Adapter will support a more user-friendly
experience by automatically unwrapping the xERC20 version of WELL back to the
[original Moonbeam native WELL token](https://moonscan.io/token/0x511ab53f793683763e5a8829738301368a2411e3)
on transfer, which will reduce the number of steps required to transfer tokens
between Moonbeam and Base.

## Security

This change has been audited by Halborn Security as part of the xERC20 upgrade,
and no security issues were found. The audit report can be found
[here](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Moonwell_Finance_XWell_Token_Rate-Limiting_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf).

In order to ensure no storage slot collisions, the slither tool was used to view
the storage offset changes in the new logic contract. No storage slot collisions
were found, and a single variable `lockbox` was added to the
`WormholeUnwrapperAdapter` contract, which inherits the `WormholeBridgeAdapter`.

## Gas Costs

In order to ensure that the gas costs of the new logic contract are not
significantly higher than the old logic contract, integration and unit tests
were run to ensure the 300k gas limit was not breached, which would require
changes on the base chain to the amount of gas needed.

On an unwrap transaction, the gas cost `167148` to mint new tokens on moonbeam
on a chainforked integration test, so the gas costs are within the 300k limit.
