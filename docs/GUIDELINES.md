# Engineering Guidelines

## Testing

Moonwell has a high bar for contributions to the codebase. Engineers are
expected to have several layers of testing for all Solidity code: unit, fuzz,
integration, and invariant testing. Formal verification should be used if it is
a good fit for the problem.

All contributions should have 100% code coverage. All testing types should be
used. Code must be tested in as close to the real world conditions. You can see
your coverage using the forge coverage command. Note: the accuracy of the
coverage tool is not authoritative; if you can show your lines of code were
covered, thatâ€™s sufficient.

You may contribute to formal verification for your patch, however this is not a
strict requirement. For complex changes to the protocol, formal verification is
recommended.

The test suite should run automatically for every change in the repository, and
in pull requests tests must pass before merging.

The test suite coverage must be kept as close to 100% as possible, enforced in
pull requests.

## Code style

The most important principle in writing code is clarity. Code should be as
obvious as possible. We always prefer clear over clever. The following are a
list of principles to follow to lead in the right direction for your patch.

1. Prefer local context. Try to not do too much in one function. Do not hide
   complexity by calling into complex sub-routines.
2. Variables should be clearly named, even if it makes the name long. You can
   use Hungarian-like notation for variables like supplyAmountMantissa, here
   indicating the value is a real number with 18 decimals of precision.
3. Your code should be clear without comments, and should have comments to make
   things crystal clear to other contributors what the intent behind each line
   of code is.
4. Prefer the order
   [Checks, Effects then Interactions](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html)
   and generally avoid cross-contract interactions where possible. Additionally,
   avoid interspersing computation with effects and interactions (e.g. if you
   can calculate a value upfront, do so).
5. Try to match the code-style that already exists in the repository. Please do
   not refactor existing code styles.
6. Public functions should have NatSpec documentation, including: a notice
   briefly describing the purpose, what the parameters are, and what the return
   value is.
7. Unchecked arithmetic blocks should contain comments explaining why under or
   over flows are guaranteed not to happen. If the reason is immediately
   apparent from the line above the unchecked block, the comment may be omitted.
8. Revert messages should be clear and concise and include dynamic data where
   appropriate.

## Documentation

For contributors, project guidelines and processes must be documented publicly.

For users, features must be abundantly documented. Documentation should include
answers to common questions, solutions to common problems, and recommendations
for critical decisions that the user may face.

## Peer review

All changes must be submitted through pull requests and go through code review.

The review must be approached by the reviewer in a similar way as if it was an
audit of the code in question (but importantly it is not a substitute for). See
[this checklist](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/code-review-checklist) for
how to conduct a proper code review.

Reviewers should enforce code and project guidelines.

External contributions must be reviewed separately by multiple maintainers.

## Governance

Moonwell uses
[Forge Proposal Simulator](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/forge-proposal-simulator/)
to simplify governance proposals and ensure that any changes made to the
protocol are rigorously tested before implementation and easy to review. Any
updates to the protocol must go through a governance proposal and can only be
applied after community approval. Refer to
[Governance](./governance/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance on how to create a
proposal once you have a Pull Request ready.

## Pull requests

The title of the pull request becomes the commit message, so it should be
written in a consistent format:

1. Begin with a capital letter.
2. Do not end with a period.
3. Write in the imperative: "Add feature X" and not "Adds feature X" or "Added
   feature X".

This repository does not follow conventional commits, so do not prefix the title
with "fix:" or "feat:".

Work in progress pull requests should be submitted as Drafts and should not be
prefixed with "WIP:".

Branches should be named in a consistent format:

1. Begin with a lowercase letter.
2. Use hyphens to separate words.
3. Use a short and descriptive name.

## Security Policy

Security vulnerabilities should be disclosed to the project maintainers through
[Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/moonwell/).
