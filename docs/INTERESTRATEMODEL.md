# InterestRateModel

## Description

InterestRateModel is an abstract contract. It serves as an interface that
provides the structure for calculating borrow and supply interest rates per
timestamp in the market.

The contract is intended to be inherited and the methods to be overridden and
implemented by the child contracts.

## Contract Details

### Constants

- `isInterestRateModel`: A constant boolean value set to `true`, indicating that
  this contract is an InterestRateModel contract.

### Methods

- `getBorrowRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves)`: This abstract method
  is expected to be overridden by inheriting contracts. The purpose is to
  calculate the current borrow interest rate per timestamp given the market's
  total amount of cash, outstanding borrows, and reserves. The calculated borrow
  rate per timestamp is expected to be a percentage and scaled by 1e18.

- `getSupplyRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves, uint reserveFactorMantissa)`:
  Another abstract method meant to be overridden. It calculates the current
  supply interest rate per timestamp using the market's total cash, outstanding
  borrows, total reserves, and the current reserve factor.

## Remarks

1. This contract is abstract and doesn't contain any implementation. It is
   designed to be inherited and its methods to be implemented by the child
   contracts.

2. Both `getBorrowRate` and `getSupplyRate` are view functions, meaning they
   don't modify the state and can be called without sending a transaction.

3. The return values of `getBorrowRate` and `getSupplyRate` are scaled by 1e18
   for precision in Solidity.

4. While SafeMath is not explicitly used in this contract, it may be used in the
   implementations of these functions in the child contracts to prevent
   underflows and overflows.

5. The boolean constant `isInterestRateModel` serves as an indicator for
   contract inspection. It is not crucial for the functionality but can be
   helpful for validation and contract interaction checks.
