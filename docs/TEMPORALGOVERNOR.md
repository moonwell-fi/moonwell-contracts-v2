# TemporalGovernor

## Overview

The `TemporalGovernor` smart contract is designed to govern the Base deployment
of Moonwell by leveraging the Wormhole bridge as the source of truth. The
contract receives actions from the Moonbeam chain through the Wormhole bridge
and executes them on the Base chain. It ensures that the execution of actions is
performed securely and in a timely manner.

### Assumptions

There are several assumptions made in this contract:

1. The Wormhole bridge is secure and will not send malicious messages or be
   deactivated.
2. Moonbeam is secure.
3. Governance on Moonbeam cannot be compromised.

If any of these assumptions are untrue, it can impact the functionality of the
contract. For example:

- If the Wormhole bridge is deactivated, the contract will be unable to upgrade
  the Base instance.
- If the Wormhole bridge sends malicious messages, the contract will be paused,
  and a new governor will need to be assigned to regain control.
- If Moonbeam is not secure, the contract will be paused until the security
  issue is resolved.
- If Moonbeam governance is compromised, the contract will be paused until
  governance control is restored.

## High-Level Architecture

The `TemporalGovernor` contract is implemented in Solidity and follows the
ERC-20 standard. It utilizes several external libraries and contracts for
various functionalities.

### External Libraries and Contracts Used

- `EnumerableSet` from the OpenZeppelin library is used for managing sets of
  trusted senders.
- `SafeCast` from the OpenZeppelin library is used for safely casting between
  different integer types.
- `Pausable` from the OpenZeppelin library is used to implement the pausing
  functionality.
- `Ownable` from the OpenZeppelin library is used to provide ownership and
  access control.

### Contract Structure

The contract is divided into the following sections:

1. **Immutable Variables:** These are variables that cannot be changed once the
   contract is deployed. They include references to the Wormhole bridge and the
   proposal delay duration.
2. **Storage Variables:** These are variables that store the contract state and
   are stored in a single storage slot. They include the last pause time and a
   flag to indicate whether the guardian can pause the contract.
3. **Mappings:** These mappings store the trusted senders and record processed
   messages to prevent replaying.
4. **Constructor:** The contract constructor initializes the contract by setting
   the immutable variables and populating the trusted senders mapping.
5. **View Functions:** These functions provide read-only access to the contract
   state, such as checking if an address is a trusted sender or retrieving the
   list of trusted senders for a chain.
6. **Governor/Guardian Only Functions:** These functions can only be called by
   the governor or guardian of the contract. They include revoking the
   guardian's ability, granting/rejecting guardian pause, and executing
   proposals.
7. **Permissionless APIs:** These functions can be called by anyone and do not
   require special permissions. They include queuing proposals, executing
   proposals, and permissionless unpause.
8. **Helper Functions:** These are internal functions used for queueing and
   executing proposals, as well as sanity checks for payload parameters.

## Permissioning System

The `TemporalGovernor` contract utilizes a permissioning system to control
access and ensure the security of the governance process. The key components of
the permissioning system are:

1. **Trusted Senders:** Each chain has a list of trusted senders. Only messages
   from these trusted senders are accepted and processed by the contract. The
   contract owner can update the list of trusted senders through governance
   proposals.
2. **Governor:** The governor has the authority to control the contract, execute
   proposals, and manage the trusted senders. Initially, the contract owner acts
   as the governor. However, the governance process can revoke the guardian's
   ability, preventing them from pausing the contract or fast-tracking
   proposals.
3. **Guardian Pause:** The guardian has the ability to pause the contract
   temporarily. When the guardian pauses the contract, all proposal executions
   are halted. The contract can only be unpaused by a governance proposal after
   a specified time delay.
4. **Permissionless Unpause:** After a certain time period has passed since the
   contract was paused, anyone can trigger a permissionless unpause. This allows
   the contract to be unpaused without requiring governance intervention.

## Contract Usage

The `TemporalGovernor` contract provides several functions to interact with its
functionalities. Here are the main functions categorized by access level:

### View Only APIs

- `isTrustedSender(uint16 chainId, bytes32 addr)`: Checks if the given address
  is a trusted sender for the specified chain ID.
- `allTrustedSenders(uint16 chainId)`: Retrieves the list of trusted senders for
  the specified chain ID.

### Governor/Guardian Only APIs

- `revokeGuardian()`: Revokes the guardian's ability to pause the contract and
  transfers ownership to address(0).
- `grantGuardiansPause()`: Grants the guardians the pause ability and resets the
  last pause time.
- `setTrustedSenders(TrustedSender[] calldata _trustedSenders)`: Adds the
  specified addresses as trusted senders for their respective chain IDs.
- `unSetTrustedSenders(TrustedSender[] calldata _trustedSenders)`: Removes the
  specified addresses from the trusted senders list.

### Permissionless APIs

- `queueProposal(bytes memory VAA)`: Queues a proposal by adding it to the list
  of pending proposals.
- `executeProposal(bytes memory VAA)`: Executes a proposal that has been queued
  and passed the time delay.
- `permissionlessUnpause()`: Unpauses the contract permissionlessly after the
  specified time delay.
- `fastTrackProposalExecution(bytes memory VAA)`: Allows the guardian to
  fast-track the execution of a proposal during emergencies.
- `togglePause()`: Toggles the pause status of the contract. Can only be called
  by the contract owner (governor).

### Helper Functions

- `addressToBytes(address addr)`: Converts an Ethereum address to a bytes32
  representation.
- `_sanityCheckPayload()`: Performs an arity check for payload parameters.

## Deployment Information

The `TemporalGovernor` contract requires the following parameters during
deployment:

- `wormholeCore`: Address of the Wormhole bridge contract.
- `_proposalDelay`: Amount of time (in seconds) that a proposal must wait before
  being processed.
- `_permissionlessUnpauseTime`: Amount of time (in seconds) until the contract
  can be unpaused permissionlessly.
- `_trustedSenders`: Array of `TrustedSender` structures containing the chain ID
  and addresses of trusted senders.

## Security Considerations

The `TemporalGovernor` contract should be used with caution and the following
security considerations should be taken into account:

1. Ensure that the Wormhole bridge contract is secure and cannot be deactivated
   or compromised.
2. Verify the security of the Moonbeam chain to ensure that it cannot be
   compromised.
3. Safeguard the private keys associated with the trusted senders to prevent
   unauthorized access.
4. Use the contract's pause functionality judiciously and only during
   emergencies or when necessary.
5. Regularly review and update the list of trusted senders to maintain the
   integrity of the governance process.
6. Ensure that the ownership of the contract is transferred to a reliable and
   trusted governor to prevent unauthorized access and control.
7. Never revoke all of the trusted senders unless governance is being deprecated
   and the markets are shut down and all users have left the protocol, or
   ownership of the Moonwell instance has been handed to another governance
   instance.
