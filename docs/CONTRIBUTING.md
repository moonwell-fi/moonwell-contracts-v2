# Contributing Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to Moonwell's Smart Contracts repository

## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/issues/new) to suggest a feature or report
a minor bug.

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed issues, and consider posting a comment
in one of those instead.

When requesting a new feature, include as many details as you can, especially around the use cases that motivate it.
Features are prioritized according to the impact they may have on the ecosystem, so we appreciate information showing
that the impact could be high.

## Submitting a pull request

If you would like to contribute to code that doesn't include any changes to the protocol you may do so by forking the
repository and submitting a pull request.

Any non-trivial code contribution must be first discussed with the maintainers in an issue (see
[Opening an issue](#opening-an-issue)). Only very minor changes are accepted without prior discussion.

Run linter, prettier and tests to make sure your pull request is good before submitting it.

If you're looking for a good place to start, look for issues labelled
["good first issue"](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/labels/good%20first%20issue)!

## Protocol changes

Moonwell V2 is a decentralized protocol, and we are committed to decentralizing its development. If you would like to
propose a change to the protocol, please follow the
[Moonwell Community Contribution Guidelines](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/moonwell-community-contribution-guidelines/706).
