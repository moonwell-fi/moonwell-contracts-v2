# TemporalGovernor Smart Contract

This document provides an overview of the `TemporalGovernor` smart contract
written in Solidity.

## Features

1. **Safe Casting Operations**: The contract leverages the OpenZeppelin
   `SafeCast` library to perform safe casting operations.

2. **Pause Functionality**: The contract uses the `Pausable` contract from
   OpenZeppelin to add pausing mechanisms. This allows certain functionalities
   of the contract to be paused and unpaused.

3. **Owner Permissions**: The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`
   contract which restricts certain functions to be executable only by the
   contract owner.

4. **Wormhole Bridge Reference**: The contract holds an immutable reference to
   the Wormhole bridge. Wormhole is a cross-chain communication protocol.

5. **Proposal Delay and Permissionless Unpause Time**: The contract keeps track
   of the time a proposal must wait before being processed and the time until
   this contract can be unpaused without permission.

6. **Trusted Senders**: The contract maintains a mapping of chain ids to trusted
   senders to validate incoming requests.

7. **Queued Transactions**: The contract also maintains a mapping of message
   hashes to `ProposalInfo` objects. This mechanism is in place to prevent
   transaction replay and enforce time limits.

## States

1. **Wormhole Bridge**: An immutable reference to the Wormhole bridge contract.

2. **Proposal Delay**: An immutable variable which keeps the amount of time a
   proposal must wait before it can be processed.

3. **Permissionless Unpause Time**: An immutable variable which defines the
   amount of time until the contract can be unpaused without any permission.

4. **Last Pause Time**: The contract maintains a timestamp of when it was last
   paused.

5. **Guardian Pause Allowed**: A Boolean variable indicating whether or not the
   guardian can pause the contract. It starts as true and then is set to false
   when the guardian pauses. It can be set to true again only by a governance
   proposal that grants the guardian the ability to pause again and sets the new
   guardian address.

6. **Trusted Senders**: A mapping from chain id to a trusted sender (in bytes32
   format). This mapping is used to validate incoming requests, ensuring only
   trusted contracts from the right chains are allowed to send requests to this
   contract.

7. **Queued Transactions**: A mapping from message hashes to `ProposalInfo`
   objects. This mapping is used to ensure transactions aren't processed more
   than once, and that a timelock on all proposals are enforced. This timelock
   can be bypassed by the guardian in case of an emergency, immediately
   executing a proposal if the contract has already been paused and the caller
   is the pause guardian.

## Functionality

The contract provides various functionalities:

- Managing trusted senders: The contract maintains a list of trusted senders and
  provides a function to update this list.

- Proposal queueing and execution: Proposals can be queued and later executed.

- Pausing and unpausing: The contract can be paused and unpaused. After a
  certain delay, it can be unpaused without any permission (permissionless
  unpause).

- Guardian management: The contract allows for a guardian who can pause the
  contract. This ability can be granted, revoked, and its status can be toggled.
  The guardian's ability to pause is revoked when the contract is paused.

- Emergency actions: In case of an emergency, the contract provides a fast-track
  mechanism for proposals to be executed only when the contract is paused. A
  proposal cannot be fast tracked when the contract is unpaused.

- Helper functions: There are several private helper functions used internally
  by the contract for queueing proposals, executing proposals, and performing
  payload sanity checks.

## Security Considerations

The Temporal Governor makes trust assumptions that the governor contract(s) on
external chains are not malicious. Should the owner of the Temporal Governor
turn malicious, the following are the destructive actions they can take:

- A malicious proposal from a trusted sender can remove all trusted senders,
  making the contract inoperable. Without trusted senders, no VAA's are valid.
- A malicious pause from the pause guardian can prevent valid governance
  proposals from being executed for a period of ten days, until the contract
  automatically unpauses.
- There are no payable functions on Temporal Governor, so it cannot send Ether
  as part of its governance proposals unless a contract with Ether is
  self-destructed to give Ether to the Temporal Governor. If self-destruct is
  removed, there is no way to send Ether to the Temporal Governor.
- If enough Wormhole signers become malicious, then they can create valid VAA's
  that have malicious payloads. Wormhole is assumed to be trusted and secure.

If any of these assumptions are violated, it becomes hard to reason about the
state the system should be in.
