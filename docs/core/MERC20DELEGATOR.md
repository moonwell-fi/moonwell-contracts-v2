# MErc20Delegator

## Overview

The MErc20Delegator delegate calls into the MErc20Delegate contract. This allows
the implementation to be upgraded at a future point in time if needed.

Summary of Functions and Events in the MErc20Delegator Contract:

1. Constructor:

   - Initializes the MErc20Delegator contract with the provided parameters.
   - Sets the admin as the contract creator during initialization.
   - Calls the "initialize" function on the implementation contract with the
     provided parameters.
   - Sets the new implementation address.
   - Sets the proper admin after initialization.

2. \_setImplementation:

   - Called by the admin to update the implementation of the delegator contract.
   - If "allowResign" is true, it calls "\_resignImplementation" on the old
     implementation.
   - Updates the implementation address to the new implementation provided.
   - Calls "\_becomeImplementation" on the new implementation with the provided
     "becomeImplementationData".
   - Emits a "NewImplementation" event.

   - Accrues interest regardless of the operation's success.

6. redeemUnderlying:

   - Sender redeems mTokens for a specified amount of underlying asset.

    - Get the current allowance from `owner` for `spender`.

15. balanceOf:

    - Get the mToken balance of the `owner`.

16. balanceOfUnderlying:

    - Get the underlying balance of the `owner`, accruing interest.

17. getAccountSnapshot:

    - Get a snapshot of the account's balances and the cached exchange rate.

18. borrowRatePerTimestamp:

    - Returns the current per-timestamp borrow interest rate for this mToken.

19. supplyRatePerTimestamp:

    - Returns the current per-timestamp supply interest rate for this mToken.

20. totalBorrowsCurrent:

    - Returns the current total borrows plus accrued interest.

21. borrowBalanceCurrent:

    - Accrue interest to the updated borrowIndex and calculate the account's
      borrow balance.

22. borrowBalanceStored:

    - Return the borrow balance of an account based on stored data.

23. exchangeRateCurrent:

    - Accrue interest and return the up-to-date exchange rate.

24. exchangeRateStored:

    - Calculate the exchange rate from the underlying to the mToken without
      accruing interest.

25. getCash:

    - Get the cash balance of this mToken in the underlying asset.

26. accrueInterest:

    - Apply accrued interest to total borrows and reserves.

27. seize:

    - Transfer collateral tokens (this market) to the liquidator during
      liquidation.

28. sweepToken:

    - callable only by the admin

29. Admin Functions:

    - \_setPendingAdmin: Begins the transfer of admin rights.
    - \_setComptroller: Sets a new comptroller for the market.

    - delegateToImplementation: Delegates execution to the implementation
      contract.
    - delegateToViewImplementation: Delegates execution to an implementation
