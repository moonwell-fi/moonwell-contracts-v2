The Moonwell system is a Compound based lending market. The system consists of
the following contracts.

- [TemporalGovernor](./TEMPORALGOVERNOR.md): A cross chain governance contract
  that allows proposals passed by the community on moonbeam to be relayed across
  the chain to the Base network. This contract owns the entire system deployment
  on base.
- [JumpRateModel](./JUMPRATEMODEL.md): Jump rate model contract that
  automatically adjusts the interest rate based on the utilization rate.
- [GovProposals](./GOVPROPOSALS.md): Documentation on submitting proposals to
  the TemporalGovernor contract using the cross chain proposal simulation
  framework.
- [ChainlinkOracle](./CHAINLINKORACLE.md): A Chainlink oracle contract that
  allows the system to fetch the price of assets on the Ethereum network. Maps
  the underlying token symbol to a chainlink feed address for easy lookups of
  price. Allows admin (temporal governor) to override the price of an asset in
  case of a price feed failure.
- [ChainlinkCompositeOracle](./CHAINLINKCOMPOSITEORACLE.md): A Chainlink
  composite oracle contract that combines multiple Chainlink oracles into a
  single oracle. This allows the system to fetch and combine the price of assets
  on the base network from multiple sources and receive the product of the
  results. Two or three asset prices can be combined together, and the result
  can be used as the price of a new asset. This is useful for calculating the
  price of a synthetic asset that is a combination of multiple assets. Conforms
  with the Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface.
- [Unitroller](./UNITROLLER.md): A proxy contract that delegates calls to the
  Comptroller contract. This contract is used to upgrade the Comptroller
  contract and hold all state.
- [Comptroller](./COMPTROLLER.md): A logic contract that handles the business
  logic of the system. Validates user actions such as liquidating, supplying and
  borrowing assets. Stores important variables such as the liquidation
  incentive, close factor, and markets users have entered.
- [InterestRateModel](./INTERESTRATEMODEL.md): An abstract interest rate model
  contract with no functions that defines an interface for all interest rate
  models. This contract is used by the JumpRateModel contract.
- [MToken](./MTOKEN.md): A contract that represents a token that has been
  supplied to the system. Users can supply and borrow this token. The contract
  also allows users to redeem their tokens for the underlying asset.
- [WETHRouter](./WETHROUTER.md): A contract that allows users to wrap their ETH
  and then mint mWETH atomically. This contract also allows users to unwrap
  their mWETH and then unwrap their WETH into ETH atomically by first approving
  the contract to spend their mWETH.
- [MultiRewardDistributor](./MULTIREWARDDISTRIBUTOR.md): Reward distributor
  contract that allows the system to distribute rewards for supplying and
  borrowing in multiple reward tokens per MToken. This contract is used by the
  Comptroller contract. This contract's admin is the Comptroller's admin which
  is the Temporal Governor.
- [MERC20Delegator](./MERC20DELEGATOR.md): A proxy contract that delegates calls
  to the MERC20Delegate contract. This contract is used to upgrade the
  MERC20Delegate contract and hold all state.
- [MERC20Delegate](./MERC20DELEGATE.md): A logic contract that handles the
  business logic of the MERC20Delegator contract. This contract inherits the
  MToken contract and provides all the functionality of the MToken contract.
- [Deployment](../SETUP.md): Documentation on how to deploy the Moonwell system
  on the base or base goerli network.
- [Testing](../run.sh): Shell script file to run all the different tests.
  Requires setting both `ARB_RPC_URL` and `ETH_RPC_URL` environment variables to
  work properly.
