# TemporalGovernor Smart Contract

This document provides an overview of the `TemporalGovernor` smart contract
written in Solidity.

## Features

1. **Safe Math Operations**: The contract leverages the OpenZeppelin `SafeCast`
   library to perform safe casting operations.

2. **Pause Functionality**: The contract uses the `Pausable` contract from
   OpenZeppelin to add pausing mechanisms. This allows certain functionalities
   of the contract to be paused and unpaused.

3. **Owner Permissions**: The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`
   contract which restricts certain functions to be executable only by the
   contract owner.

4. **Wormhole Bridge Reference**: The contract holds an immutable reference to
   the Wormhole bridge. Wormhole is a cross-chain communication protocol.

5. **Proposal Delay and Permissionless Unpause Time**: The contract keeps track
   of the time a proposal must wait before being processed and the time until
   this contract can be unpaused without permission.

6. **Trusted Senders**: The contract maintains a mapping of chain ids to trusted
   senders to validate incoming requests.

7. **Queued Transactions**: The contract also maintains a mapping of message
   hashes to `ProposalInfo` objects. This mechanism is in place to prevent
   transaction replay and enforce time limits.

## States

1. **Wormhole Bridge**: An immutable reference to the Wormhole bridge contract.

2. **Proposal Delay**: An immutable variable which keeps the amount of time a
   proposal must wait before it can be processed.

3. **Permissionless Unpause Time**: An immutable variable which defines the
   amount of time until the contract can be unpaused without any permission.

4. **Last Pause Time**: The contract maintains a timestamp of when it was last
   paused.

5. **Guardian Pause Allowed**: A Boolean variable indicating whether or not the
   guardian can pause the contract. It starts as true and then is set to false
   when the guardian pauses.

6. **Trusted Senders**: A mapping from chain id to a trusted sender (in bytes32
   format). This mapping is used to validate incoming requests.

7. **Queued Transactions**: A mapping from message hashes to `ProposalInfo`
   objects. This mapping is used to ensure transactions aren't processed more
   than once, and that time restrictions are enforced.

## Functionality

The contract provides various functionalities:

- Managing trusted senders: The contract maintains a list of trusted senders and
  provides a function to update this list.

- Proposal queueing and execution: Proposals can be queued and later executed.

- Pausing and unpausing: The contract can be paused and unpaused. After a
  certain delay, it can be unpaused without any permission (permissionless
  unpause).

- Guardian management: The contract allows for a guardian who can pause the
  contract. This ability can be granted, revoked, and its status can be toggled.
  The guardian's ability to pause is revoked when the contract is paused.

- Emergency actions: In case of an emergency, the contract provides a fast-track
  mechanism for proposals to be executed only when the contract is paused. A
  proposal cannot be fast tracked when the contract is unpaused.

- Helper functions: There are several private helper functions used internally
  by the contract for queueing proposals, executing proposals, and performing
  payload sanity checks.
