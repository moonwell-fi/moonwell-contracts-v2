# System Setup

set your env vars:

`ETH_PRIVATE_KEY, DO_DEPLOY, and DO_AFTERDEPLOY to true`

if deploying on base goerli, go to Addresses.json and delete everything after
this line `        /// ---------- base goerli deployment ----------` and before
this line` ` /// -----------------------------------------------`

then to deploy the entire system on base goerli:

`forge script src/proposals/DeployProposal.s.sol:DeployProposal -vvv --rpc-url baseGoerli --with-gas-price 100000000 --skip-simulation --slow --gas-estimate-multiplier 200 --broadcast --etherscan-api-key baseGoerli --verify`

Substitute out the rpc-url for the chain to deploy on if the destination is not
base goerli.

If deploying on mainnet, double check that `mainnetMTokens.json` and
`mainnetRewardStreams.json` in the `proposals/` folder are correctly filled out.
Then, double check that in `Addresses.json`, all the oracles, tokens and
guardians are correctly set. If no reward streams will be created, ensure the
rewards json file is an empty array. Triple check that the addresses for the
system are correct in `Addresses.json`, then deploy to base mainnet:

`forge script src/proposals/DeployProposal.s.sol:DeployProposal -vvv --rpc-url base --with-gas-price 100000000 --skip-simulation --slow --gas-estimate-multiplier 200 --broadcast --etherscan-api-key base --verify`

Once contracts are deployed, add generated address json into the Addresses.json
file.

Create the calldata to submit on the proposing chain, for testnet fork base
goerli:

`forge test --match-test testPrintCalldata -vvv --fork-url baseGoerli`

for mainnet calldata:

`forge test --match-test testPrintCalldata -vvv --fork-url base`

Then, scroll up to get the calldata after section "artemis governor queue
governance calldata", and send the calldata to the governance contract on
moonbase by going to metamask and submitting a transaction to the
ArtemisGovernor contract with the calldata the raw hex copied.

Once the calldata is sent, wait for the proposal to finish the voting period,
then queue and execute it.

If on base goerli, send .00001 eth to the Temporal Governor contract. If on
mainnet, send .00001 eth to the Temporal Governor contract and all required
amounts for other tokens as well.

After the proposal is executed, get the proposal execute transaction hash, and
pass the transaction hash to the VAA script.

Once the VAA is generated, go through the steps to submit the VAA to the
Temporal Governor on the destination chain.

1. Submit the generated VAA to the Temporal Governor on the destination chain by
   calling queueProposal.
2. Wait for the timelock to expire. Then submit the same VAA bytes to the
   Temporal Governor by calling executeProposal. This should execute the
   proposal.
